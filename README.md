# NBA-Referee-Stats

## Creative visualization of various foul calls in the NBA from the 2017 to 2020 Season. 

# The following list are the steps I will execute in the following visuals. 
- Grouping the data by each season and within the seasons, I will differentiate the type of season. (Regular Season and Playoffs)
- Creating various histograms to show the counts of different fouls
- Linechart that plots the total fouls for each year
- Different chart that shows shooting fouls and charges in the playoffs and regular season
- Inputting a correlation chart, displaying the correlation between various variables
- Various boxplot, comparing the two different type of seasons

I have always been curious about frequency of charging and shooting fouls for the playoffs and regular season.  Nornally playoff basketball is all about half court offense.  Not a lot of charging fouls will occur because the game is much slower. Charging fouls, on average, happens when the game is played fast.
